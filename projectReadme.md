Trump Invaders
Space Invaders clone with the invaders replaced with 8-bit/pixellated trump faces.

Defender/cannon will be Hillary Clinton. 
Bullets will look like emails. 
Three defense bunkers will be Obama, Warren, and Bernie, maybe. 
Trumps will move horizontally and advance down the screen. 
Clinton will move horizontally and fire up at them.

Stretch goals: 
Maybe bernie is better as a power-up for hillary. 
Trump toupee as random/occasional fast moving enemy.

Technologies: HTML, CSS (not sure if flexbox or skeleton), jQuery and vanilla javascript.
