That Darn Cat!

I this game your cat is on the shelf and is knocking items off of it. 
You can click to move items back onto the shelf. 
If the cat pushes items off the edge of the shelf it falls and breaks, and you lose. 

The game can go on indefinitely as long as the player keeps the item on the shelf.
